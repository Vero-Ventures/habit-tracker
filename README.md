## **Project Description**

We are excited to embark on an ambitious initiative to create a mobile app designed to promote healthy living and wellness optimization through:

- Habit logging
- Fitness trackers
- Medical test analysis
- Personalized AI coaching

With a foundation in the CST program's Web and Mobile option, this app will be a fresh greenfield project iterating on an existing concept prototype called Live Timeless. Students will be encouraged to:

- Reassess and redesign this app from the ground up
- Pick an appropriate and modern tech stack
- Integrate with public APIs

This initiative will serve as a cornerstone for a broader corporate wellness program, blending financial incentives with health optimization. The goal is to empower users with actionable insights into their wellness journey, guided by:

- Fitness tracker data
- Regular blood-work
- Social groups
- A personalized AI chatbot coach
- A corporate wellness program

## **Programming Language(s)**

Students will be expected to assess the project and pick an appropriate tech stack based on the project requirements and their capabilities. There is a strong preference for modern, popular, and open-source technologies. Examples include:

- Flutter
- React Native
- Django
- Laravel

(All technologies chosen must be free and open-source)

Students will also be given the opportunity to use APIs of existing services to augment their app's capabilities. Examples include:

- OAuth / Firebase for authentication
- Apple HealthKit / Google Fit for fitness trackers
- OpenAI GPT for AI customized coaching chatbots
- Tesseract for document OCR

Additionally, students will have the chance to build their own DevOps pipeline, striving for continuous integration and deployment to the app store and to the cloud. We will be using GitHub Workflows and Actions. The use of a Mono-Repo is encouraged.

## **Hardware/Software Requirements**

Development will utilize open-source tools, with students using their own computing resources. Fitness wearables and health data will be provided as needed.

## **Current Work/Arrangement**

Transitioning from manual and fragmented wellness tracking, this project aims for a technological leap. The existing mobile app, built with React Native & Laravel, provides a valuable learning platform, but the goal is to innovate beyond its current capabilities, creating a new, more sophisticated solution. The project aims to digitize and enhance the wellness tracking process, currently reliant on manual inputs and disparate systems. By leveraging Agile methodologies and a robust DevOps pipeline, we intend to streamline development and deployment, ensuring a seamless and scalable solution.
